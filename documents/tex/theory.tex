\chapter{Theory}

In this chapter, we give a theoretical introduction to the topic dealt with in this thesis. The ultimate goal of this chapter is to introduce and describe a analytical model for subsurface scattering. First, we will give a brief introduction to what light is, and how we physically describe it. Secondly, we will introduce the basic radiometric quantities that will be used throughout the chapter. Then, we will describe how this quantities are related and can be used to describe light-material interaction, using reflectance functions, of which BSSRDF functions are a special case. Finally, we will introduce subsurface scattering and the diffusion approximation, concluding with a description of two BSSRDF functions actually used to describe it, by \cite{Jensen:2001:PMS:383259.383319} and \cite{IMM2013-06646}.

\section{Light and Radiometry}
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, that propagates through space as a sinusoidal wave. Usually by "light` we usually refer to \emph{visible light}, the small part of the electromagnetic spectrum the human eye is sensible to (see Figure \ref{fig:spectrum}). This small window is between the \SI{380}{\nano\meter} of the infrared and \SI{750}{\nano\meter} of the ultraviolet, but the precise boundaries vary according to the environment and the observer. Instead explicitly noted, we will use the terms light and visible light interchangeably in this report.

The study of light is usually referred as optics. In computer aided image synthesis, we are interested in representing faithfully how visible light propagates though the scene and how interacts with materials. In addition, we are usually interested on lighting effects that are noticeable at human scales (\SI{1}{\milli\meter} - \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}). For example, we are interested in subsurface scattering, absorption and emission phenomena but not in diffraction, interference and quantum effects, that for visible light happen on a microscopic scale (\SI{1}{\nano\meter} - \SI{1}{\micro\meter}).

\end{figure}

The study of the measurement of electromagnetic radiation is called \emph{radiometry}. The energy of light, like all the others forms of energy, is measured in \emph{Joules} [\si{\joule} $=$ \si{\kg\meter\square\per\second\square}], and its power in \emph{Watts} [\si{\watt} $=$ \si{\kg\meter\square\per\second\cubed}]. \emph{Photometry}, on the other hand, measures electromagnetic radiation as it is perceived from the human eye, and limits itself only to the visible spectrum, while radiometry spans all of it. The quantities for energy and power are called respectively \emph{talbot} [\si{\candela\second}] and \emph{candela} [\si{\candela}]. 

In image synthesis radiometry is employed, as its quantities directly derive from the electromagnetic theories, are universal, and can be easily converted to the photometric ones when necessary. The most important radiometric quantities used in computer graphics are \emph{radiant flux}, \emph{radiant energy}, \emph{radiance}, \emph{irradiance} and \emph{intensity}.

\section{Radiometric quantities}

\subsection{Radiant flux}
The radiant flux, also known as radiant power, is the most basic quantity in radiometry. It is usually indicated with the letter $\Phi$ and it is measured in joules per seconds [\si{\joule\per\second}] or Watts [\si{\watt}]. The quantity indicates how much power the light irradiates per unit time. Given its nature, the radiant flux is independent from the distance from the light source.

\subsection{Radiant energy}
Radiant energy, usually indicated as $Q$, is the energy that the light carries in a certain amount of time. Like all the other SI units for energy, it is measured in joules [\si{\joule}]. Radiant energy is usually obtained integrating the radiant flux along time for an interval $\Delta T$:

$$
Q = \int_{\Delta T} \Phi \; dt
$$

Due to the dual nature of the light, the energy carried by the light can be derived both considering the flux of photons as particles, or considering light as a wave. We will not dig further into the topic, because for rendering purposes is not important if we characterize light as a flux of particles or as a sinusoidal wave.

\subsection{Irradiance}

Irradiance, usually defined as $E$, is the radiometric unit that measures the radiant flux per unit area \emph{falling} on a surface. It is measured in Watts per square meter [\si{\watt\per\square\meter}]. It is obtained by further deriving the radiant flux by the area:

$$
E = \frac{d\Phi}{dA}
$$

Irradiance is usually the term in literature used for the \emph{incoming} power per unit area. The converse, i.e. the irradiance leaving a surface, it is usually referred as \emph{radiant exitance} or \emph{radiosity}, and indicated with the letter $B$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/irradiance.pdf}
\caption{Irradiance versus power. For the two surfaces $A$ and $B$, the received power $\Phi$ is the same, while the two irradiances $E_A$ and $E_B$ are different, as the area of $B$ is twice as the one of $A$.}
\label{fig:irradiance}
\end{figure}
 

\subsection{Intensity}
Intensity is defined as the differential radiant flux per differential solid angle:

$$
I(\vomega) = \frac{d \Phi}{d \omega}
$$

It is measured in Watts / steradian [\si{\watt\per\steradian}] and it is indicated with the letter $I$. Intensity is often a misused term in the physics community, as it is used for many different measures. Depending on the community, intensity may refer to irradiance or even to radiance (see the following section). We will refer to intensity as it is generally interpreted by the optics community, i.e. radiant intensity. 


\subsection{Radiance}


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/radiance.pdf}
\caption{Radiance. The element of area $dA$ gets projected according to the angle $\theta = \cos^{-1}{\vec{n} \cdot \vomega}$. Then the incoming flux $\Phi$ gets divided by the projected area and by the solid angle subtended by it.}
\label{fig:radiance}
\end{figure}


Radiance is the most important quantity in image synthesis. It is defined precisely as the differential of the flux per solid angle per projected surface area, and it is measured in Watt per steradian per square meter [\si{\watt\per\steradian\meter\square}].

$$
L(\vomega) = \frac{d^2 \Phi}{d\omega dA \cos \theta}
$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the surface normal and the incoming ray of light (so that $\cos\theta = \vec{n} \cdot \vomega_i$). Radiance is important in image synthesis because it is the natural quantity to associate with a ray of light, as it remains constant along it. In addition, the sensibility of the human eye to light is directly proportional to the radiance. For a discussion on why radiance is related to the sensitivity of sensors and the human eye, see X.

All the other radiometric quantities can be derived from radiance:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E &= \int_{2\pi} L_i(\vomega) \cos\theta \; d\omega \\
B &= \int_{2\pi} L_o(\vomega) \cos\theta \; d\omega \\
I(\vomega) &= \int_A L(\vomega) \cos\theta \; dA \\
\Phi &= \int_A \int_{2\pi} L(\vomega) \cos\theta \; d\omega dA
\end{split}
\label{eq:radiancederivation} 
\end{equation}

For simplicity of notation, in the previous notations the dependence from the point of incidence $\x$ has been dropped. In principle, all the quantities listed in equation \ref{eq:radiancederivation} are dependent on $\x$.

\subsection{Radiometric quantities for simple lights}

To help with the formulas used later in the report, we derive the above mentioned radiometric quantities for the two simplest types of light, i.e. directional and point lights.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Directional lights} simulate very distant light sources, in which all the rays of light are parallel (e.g. the sun). They are represented by a direction $\vomega_l$ and a constant radiance value, $L$. 
	\item \textit{Point lights} simulate lights closer to the observer. Isotropic point lights are represented by a position of the light $\x_l$ and a constant intensity $I$. Point lights have a falloff that depends on the inverse square law, i.e. the radiance diminishes with the square of the distance.
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{table:radio} shows different radiometric quantities evaluated for point and directional lights, for a surface point $\x$ with surface normal $\vec{n}$.

\section{Reflectance Functions}
 
After introducing the basic radiometric quantities, we still lack a way to describe light material interaction. More precisely, we need a way to relate the incoming and the outgoing radiance on a point of a chosen surface. As we have already discussed before, we use radiance since is the radiometric quantity that is directly proportional to what the human eye measures. 

\subsection{BRDF functions}

One of the possible way to describe light-material interaction is by using a BDRF function, acronym for \emph{Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function}. The BRDF function $f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o)$ is defined on one point $\x$ of the surface as the differential ratio between the exiting radiance and the incoming irradiance:

\begin{equation}
f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) = \frac{d L_o(\x, \vomega_o)}{d E_i(\x, \vomega_i)} = \frac{d L_o(\x, \vomega_o)}{L_i(\x, \vomega_i) \cos\theta_i d \vomega_i}
\label{eq:brdf}
\end{equation}

The BRDF states that the incoming and the outgoing radiance are proportional, so that the energy hitting the material at the point $\x$ is proportional to the energy coming out from the point. The BRDF function is generically reciprocal for the Hemholtz reciprocity principle ( $f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) = f(\x, \vomega_o, \vomega_i)$), and anisotropic (if the surface changes orientation and $\vomega_i$ and $\vomega_o$ stays the same, the resulting BRDFs are different). In addition, it is positive( $f(\x, \vomega_o, \vomega_i) \ge 0$), and conserves energy, so that the energy of the outgoing ray is no grater that the one of the incoming one ($\int_{2\pi}  f(\x, \vomega_o, \vomega_i) \cos\theta_o d\vomega_o \le 1$).

By inverting equation \ref{eq:brdf}, we obtain the so-called \emph{reflectance equation}:

$$
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) = \int_{2\pi} f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) L_i(\x, \vomega_i) \cos\theta_i d\vomega_i
$$

That later we will extend to obtain the rendering equation. The BRDF function has some limitations, being not able to account for all phenomena. For example, with a BRDF it is not possible to account for subsurface scattering phenomena, because it assumes the light enters and leaves the material in the same point. To model these phenomena, more complicated functions are needed, like the BSSRDF function described later in this chapter. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/brdf.pdf}
\caption{Setup for a BRDF. Note that the light enetrs and leaves the surface at the same point.}
\label{fig:brdf}
\end{figure}
 

\subsection{Examples of BRDF functions}

There are many examples of BRDF functions in literature. In this section, we will introduce three of the simplest ones: for a more exhaustive description of BRDF functions, refer to X. The three BRDFs are the lambertian or diffuse BRDF, the specular or mirror BRDF and the family of glossy BRDFs.

\subsubsection{Lambertian BRDF}

In the lambertian BRDF, the incoming radiance is distributed equally in all directions, regardless of the incoming direction. To do this, the BRDF must be constant:

$$
f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) = k_d
$$

We can check that then the radiance is scattered equally in all directions by simple integration:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) &= \int_{2\pi} f_d L_i(\x, \vomega_i) \cos\theta_i d\vomega_i \\
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) &= k_d \int_{2\pi} L_i(\x, \vomega_i) \cos\theta_i d\vomega_i \\
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) &= k_d \; E(\x) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The lambertian model is an ideal model, so very few material exhibit a lambertian diffusion, like unfinished wood or spectralon, a synthetic material created in order to have a lambertian diffusion. 

\subsubsection{Mirror BRDF}

Another simple kind of BRDF is the perfectly specular BRDF, or mirror BRDF. In this function, all the incoming radiance from one direction $\vomega_i$ is completely diffused into the reflected direction $\vomega_r$, defined as $\vomega_r = \vomega_i - 2 (\vomega_i \cdot \vec{n}) \vec{n}$. The resulting BRDF is defined as follows:

$$
f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) = \frac{\delta(\vomega_o - \vomega_r)}{\cos\theta_i} 
$$

The function $\delta(\vomega)$ is a hemispheric delta function. Once integrated over a hemisphere, the function evaluates to one only for the vector $\vomega = \mathbf{0}$. Putting the BRDF into the reflectance equation gives the following outgoing radiance:

\begin{equation*}
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) = \begin{cases}
L_i(\x, \vomega_i)  &\text{if $\vomega_o = \vomega_r$}\\
0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

that is the expected result, as all the radiance is reflected into the direction $\vomega_r$.

\subsubsection{Glossy BRDFs}

As we can see from real life experience, rarely objects are completely diffuse or completely specular. These two models are idealized models, that represent an ideal case. So, to create a realistic BRDF model, we often need to combine the two terms and add an additional one, called glossy reflection. This term is often needed to model the behavior of the surface more realistically, especially at grazing angles.

The most used BRDF model used to model glossy reflections is based on microfacet theory. In this theory, the surface of an object is modeled as composed of small mirrors. In one of its classical formulation, the BRDF is represented as:

$$
f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) = \frac{D G R}{4 \cos\theta_r \cos\theta_i} = \frac{G R}{4} \frac{(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{h})^s}{(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{n}\cdot\vomega_i)}
$$

$D$ regulates how microfacets are distributed, and it is often modeled as $(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{h})^s$, where $\vec{h}$ is the half vector between the eye and the light, and $s$ is an attenuation parameter. $\vec{h}$ is defined as:

$$
\vec{h} = \frac{\vomega_o + \vomega_i}{\left\| \vomega_o + \vomega_i \right\|}
$$

$G$ accounts for the object self shadowing, while $R$ is the Fresnel reflection term (more details in section Y).	$\vec{r}$ is the reflection vector as defined in the previous section. See figure Z on how the vectors for the glossy reflection - $\vec{n}$, $\vec{h}$ and $\vec{r}$ - are defined.

Various alternative definitions exist for the $D$ and $G$ function, varying among the literature. Other glossy models not based on microfacet theory do exist as well. 

\subsection{The rendering equation}

Given the reflectance equation, it is possible to generalize it in order to model all the lighting in an environment. In fact, this form of the reflectance equation does not account for two important factors. 

The first factor are emissive surfaces. We need to add an emissive radiance term $L_e(\x, \vomega)$ that models how much radiance is a point on a surface emitting in a certain directions. This is useful to model lights as any other surface in the scene. Note that point lights have a singularity: they emit infinite radiance on the point they are placed.

The second factor is that the reflectance equation accounts only for direct illumination. In general, we want to model global illumination, i.e. to include also light that bounced onto another surface before reaching the current surface. To model this, we can replace the $L_i$ term in the reflectance equation with another term $L_r$ that accounts for reflected radiance. This term can be usually modeled as the product of the radiance of the light plus a visibility function $V(\x)$.

Accounting for all the described factors, we reach one formulation of the rendering equation:

$$
L_o(\x, \vomega_o) = L_e(\x, \vomega) + \int_{2\pi} f(\x, \vomega_i, \vomega_o) L_i(\x, \vomega_i) V(\x) \cos\theta_i d\vomega_i
$$

This form of the rendering equation is still not completely general, since it is based on a BRDF, so it is not possible to model subsurface scattering effects or wavelength-changing effects (like iridescence). We will extend the rendering equation in order to account for these phenomena later on in this chapter.

\subsection{Fresnel equations}

Until now, on the described BRDF models, we did consider only the reflected part of the radiance. When a beam of light coming from direction $\vomega_i$ hits a surface, only part of the incoming radiance gets reflected, while another part gets refracted into the material. As we can see from the setup from figure Z, we obtain the two vectors $\vomega_r$ and $\vomega_t$, the reflected and refracted vector, defined as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\vomega_r &= \vomega_i - 2 (\vomega_i \cdot \vec{n}) \vec{n} \\
\vomega_t &= \eta ((\vomega_i \cdot \vec{n}) \vec{n} - \vomega_i) - \vec{n} \sqrt{1 - \eta^2 (1 - (\vomega_i \cdot \vec{n}) ^ 2)}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Where $\eta = \frac{n_1}{n_2}$ is the relative index of refraction of the material. With this setup, we can use a solution to Maxwell's equations for wave propagation to describe how light spreads between reflected and refracted directions. What we obtain are called \emph{Fresnel coefficients}. The coefficients are different according to the polarization of the incoming light, so there are two for the reflection ($R_s$, $R_p$) and two for transmission ($T_s$, $T_p$). The coefficients relate the incoming and outgoing power of the light, and by differentiation, the radiance as well.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
R_s = \left|\frac{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i - n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_t} {n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i + n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_t}\right|^2 \;\;\;&\;\;\; R_p = \left|\frac{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_t - n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_i} {n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_t + n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_i}\right|^2\\
T_s = \frac{n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_t}{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i} \left|\frac{2 n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i}{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i + n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_t}\right|^2 \;\;\;&\;\;\; T_p = \frac{n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_t}{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i}  \left|\frac{2 n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_i}{n_1 \cdot \cos\theta_t + n_2 \cdot \cos\theta_i}\right|^2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


In most computer graphics applications (and this is reasonable for most of the real-world lights), we assume that the two polarizations are equally mixed. So, we will use the coefficient $R = \frac{R_s + R_p}{2}$ and $T = \frac{T_s + T_p}{2}$ in our calculations. Note that $R + T = 1$, so the overall energy is conserved.

\subsection{BSSRDF functions and generalized rendering equation}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{images/bssrdf} 
\caption{BSSRDF setup. As we compare it to the one of figure \ref{fig:brdf}, we can see that the light enters and leaves the surface at two different points.}
\label{fig:bssrdf}
\end{figure}

As we anticipated in section TODO, the BRDF theory that was introduced before is not accurate in predicting the behavior in the lighting for all materials. In fact, BRDF model assumes that the light enters and leaves the material in the same point. While this assumption holds true for a wide range of material, like metal or plastic, it poorly describes translucent materials, that exhibit a consistent amount of light transport beneath the surface. 

In order to describe light transport in this material, we introduce a function, called BSSRDF, acronym for \emph{Bidirectional Subsurface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function}. This function extends the concept of BRDF to account for two separate points. The BSSRDF is usually indicated with a capital $S$. We define the BRDF as the ratio between the incoming flux in a point $\x_i$ from the direction $\vomega_i$ and the outgoing radiance in \emph{another} point $\x_o$ on direction $\vomega_o$:

$$
S(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) = \frac{d L_o(\x_o,\vomega_o)}{d \Phi_i(\x_i,\vomega_i)} = \frac{d L_o(\x_o,\vomega_o)}{d E_i(\x_i,\vomega_i) d A_i} = \frac{d L_o(\x_o,\vomega_o)}{L_i(\x_i,\vomega_i) \cos \theta_i d\vomega_i d A_i}  
$$

As we can see, the BSSRDF is similar to the BRDF, apart from a additional derivation in the area domain. Once we rearrange this equation, we can obtain an updated reflectance equation for the BSSRDF:

$$
L_o(\x_o,\vomega_o) = \int_A \int_{2\pi} S(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) L_i(\x_i,\vomega_i) \cos \theta_i d\vomega_i d A_i
$$

We can immediately see that the new reflectance equation accounts for light scattering between two points, but with a price. In fact, it adds a order of magnitude of the calculations, since now the BSSRDF needs to be integrated both on the surface area and the normal-defined hemisphere, while the BRDF needed only a integration over the hemisphere. 

As we did for the BRDF, we can further extend the reflectance equation to further include visibility and emission, giving an extended form of the rendering equation. 

\begin{equation}
L_o(\x_o,\vomega_o) = L_e(\x_i,\vomega_i) + \int_A \int_{2\pi} S(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) L_i(\x_i,\vomega_i) V(\x) (\vec{n} \cdot \vomega_i) d\vomega_i d A_i
\label{eq:bssrdfeq}
\end{equation}

From now on, by "rendering equation" in this report we will mean the one in equation \ref{eq:bssrdfeq}.

\end{figure}

When we derive our models for lighting, in general we assume that the light is traveling in vacuum. This assumption holds for light that is propagating though the air (which is assimilable to vacuum), but once we relax it, more variables should be taken into consideration. Objects through which light travels are referred as \emph{participating media}. In this chapter, we will derive and consider an alternative formulation of the rendering equation for light traveling into participating media, called \emph{radiative transport equation}.

When a beam of light travels through an object, various phenomena occur. A photon on the beam can be either being absorbed (disappear), scattered (change direction) or emitted (appear). These phenomena can be uniform throughout the material (homogeneous materials), as in solid material like wax or leaves, or be not uniform (heterogeneous materials), like in smoke or clouds.

We will briefly describe all three mentioned effects, then combine them to compose the radiative transport equation. The purpose is to describe how radiance varies along a beam of light with direction $\vomega$. This directional derivative is indicated as:

$$
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = \frac{\partial L_x}{\partial x} \vomega_x + \frac{\partial L_y}{\partial y} \vomega_y +\frac{\partial L_z}{\partial z} \vomega_z
$$ 

\subsection{Emission}
Emission is the natural property of the materials to emit light, i.e. to generate photons that add to the existing ones passing through the material. The effect is generally generated by chemical processes emitting photons (as in natural animals like fireflies), by natural black-body radiation emission in the visible spectrum (such as in a star like the sun or in incandescent bulbs), or by other radiation that changed its wavelength into the visible spectrum.

In the directional 3D derivative, the variance in emission is modeled as a constant depending only on the current position and direction.

$$
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = \epsilon(\x, \vomega)
$$

This means that emission increases linearly along the body: if the beam travels a distance $d$ within the medium, $d \cdot k$ photons are emitted. Emission is generally isotropic, not depending on the direction ($ \epsilon(\x, \vomega) =  \epsilon(\x)$).

\subsection{Absorption}
Absorption is a property of materials that models a simple physical phenomenon: a photon, traveling though the material, hits one atom of the material. The energy carried by the photon is then absorbed by the atom, augmenting its kinetic energy. This directly translates in an increase of heat in the material. Usually a certain percentage of the photons hits the atoms and gets absorbed. This means, if $k$ is the percentage of the photons absorbed in a unit, after one unit the original radiance will become $k \cdot L_i$, then $k^2 \cdot L_i$, etc.

If we write this phenomena as a differential equation, we get after a distance $d$ a decaying in radiance of $k^d = e^{-\sigma_a d}$, that leads to the following 3D directional derivative:

$$
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = -\sigma_a(\x,\vomega) L(\x, \vomega)
$$

$\sigma_a$ is referred as the \emph{absorption coefficient}. Also this coefficient is generically isotropic, and constant for homogenous materials.

\subsection{Out-scattering}
Out scattering is the radiance lost due to scattering. The scattering phenomenon happens when photons are deflected away from the current direction $\vomega$.  As in the previous case, the phenomena is modeled as a percentage of the radiance lost per unit length. So the loss due to out-scattering is modeled as:

$$
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = -\sigma_s(\x,\vomega) L(\x, \vomega)
$$

$\sigma_s$ is referred as the \emph{scattering coefficient}. We note that in this case we are not interested in which direction the photons are actually going. That will be accounted in the in-scattering term of another point in the material.

\subsection{In-scattering}
Given some loss due to some of the photons changing direction, there will be some of them that from other scattering events will change to the $\vomega$ direction. We need then to discover the number of photons that comes from all the other directions. To do this, we integrate the incoming radiance from all directions in the point $\x$. This quantity, similar to irradiance, in an infinite medium is called \emph{fluence}, and indicated as $\phi$:

$$
\phi(\x) = \int_{4\pi} L(\x,\vomega') d\omega'
$$

This quantity should be then averaged over the entire sphere, yielding $\frac{\phi}{4\pi}$ as a result. This quantity then is then multiplied by the scattering coefficient, because only some photons on average align to the current direction $\vomega$. This yields:

\begin{equation}
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = \sigma_s(\x) \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_{4\pi} L(\x,\vomega') d\omega'	
\label{eq:inscatter}
\end{equation}


However, equation \ref{eq:inscatter} assumes that radiance scatters equally in all directions. This is not usually the case, and the $\frac{1}{4 \pi}$ term needs to be replaced by a probability distribution function that describes how the photons scatter in the medium. This function is called phase function, and indicated as $p(\x, \vomega, \vomega')$. In the actual models its integral on the hemisphere is often used as a parameter, called \emph{mean cosine} ($g$):

$$
g(\x) = \int_{4 \pi} p(\x, \vomega, \vomega') \vomega \cdot \vomega' d \omega'
$$

This term indicates the general direction of the scattering in the material. If positive, the scattering is prevalent along the beam (forward scattering), if negative is prevalent in the opposite direction (backward scattering). If zero, the scattering is isotropic, i.e. equal in all directions.

So, the final 3D equation for in-scattering, accounting for the phase function, is as follows:

\begin{equation*}
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) = \sigma_s(\x) \int_{4\pi} p(\x, \vomega, \vomega') L(\x,\vomega') d\omega'	
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Final formulation of the radiative transport equation}
Combining emission, absorption, scattering described in the previous sections, we reach the final formulation of the radiative transport equation (RTE):

\begin{equation}
(\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vomega) L(\x, \vomega) =   -\sigma_t(\x) L(\x, \vomega) + \epsilon(\x) + \sigma_s(\x) \int_{4\pi} p(\x, \vomega, \vomega') L(\x,\vomega') d\omega'
\label{eq:rte}
\end{equation}

Where the two reducing term, scattering and absorption, have been combined together in $\sigma_t = \sigma_a + \sigma_s$, called the \emph{extinction coefficient}.


\subsection{The diffusion approximation}
The radiative transport equation \ref{eq:rte} is a integro-differential equation with many degrees of freedom. As we stated in chapter TODO, there are rendering techniques that numerically solve the equation in order to obtain a realistic result. However, analytical methods tend to use some approximations of the RTE, that hold well given specific conditions. The \emph{diffusion approximation} is one of these approximations, and it is still widely used today since its introduction in the computer graphics community by Ishimaru (TODO). 

The assumption under the diffusion approximation is simple: given that in a physical medium there are a lot of scattering events, the beam of light quickly becomes isotropic. In fact, each one of the scattering events further blurs the light distribution, and as a result the distribution becomes more uniform as the number of scattering events increases. This has been proven to be a reasonable assumption even for highly anisotropic light sources (e.g. a focused laser beam) and phase functions.

When using the diffusion approximation, instead of using the extinction coefficient $\sigma_t$, we account for the contribution from the phase function by using the so-called \emph{reduced extinction coefficient} $\sigma_t'$. It is defined as $\sigma_t' = \sigma_a + \sigma_s'$, with $\sigma_s' = \sigma_s (1 - g)$. $\sigma_s'$ Is called \emph{reduced scattering coefficient}. The converse of the reduced scattering coefficient is called \emph{mean free path} and represents the average distance that light travels in the medium before being absorbed or scattered.

The rationale behind this reduced coefficient is that a highly forward scattering material is virtually indistinguishable from a not-scattering material. So, for highy forward scattering materials ($g \approx 1$) the scattering coefficients reduces to zero. For highly backward scattering materials ($g \approx -1$), the scattering is accounted for twice as for an isotropic material. The situation is clarified in table \ref{table:coefficients}.

\end{table}

We leave to TODO and TODO for the algebraic details of the calculation. Once we solve the diffusion equation, we obtain the following formula for $\phi(\x)$, the fluence of light in an infinite scattering medium.

$$
\phi(\x) = \frac{\Phi}{4\pi D} \frac{e^{\sigma_{tr} r}}{r}
$$

We recall that $\phi(\x) = \int_{4\pi}L(\x,\vomega) d\vomega$. $r = \|\x\|$ is the distance from the point to the light source.The two coefficients $D$ and $\sigma_{tr}$ are called \emph{diffusion coefficient} and \emph{transmission coefficient} respectively. The two coefficients are defined as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
D &= \frac{1}{3 \sigma_t'} \\
\sigma_{tr} &= \sqrt{3 \sigma_a \sigma_t'} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_a}{D}}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

We recall that this is the equation for an infinite medium, i.e. no surface interaction is considered. In order to derive an actual BSSRDF model from the diffusion approximation, \emph{boundary conditions} must be considered. Jensen TODO derived an analytical model starting from this approximation of the RTE, while Frisvad TODO uses a more complex approximation of the RTE. The two models are explained in the following sections.

\subsection{Standard dipole model}

The first model we describe is due to TODO Jensen et al. in their original paper, they used the diffusion approximation for light in an infinite medium described in the previous section. Starting from that, they derive an approximation that holds for light in a semi-infinite medium, i.e. light traveling in void hitting a planar slab of a translucent material.

As a boundary condition, we take the light coming \emph{out} of the material. Light coming out of the material has a initial fluence $\phi_0$. We assume then that the fluency decays linearly until a distance $z = 2 A D$ from the surface, where it becomes zero. $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, while $A$ is a corrective term that accounts for materials with a different indices of refraction:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A &= \frac{1 + F_{dr}}{1 - F_{dr}} \\
F_{dr} &= \int_{2\pi} R(\eta, \vec{n} \cdot \vomega)  (\vec{n} \cdot \vomega) d \vomega
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $R$ is the Fresnel reflection term as defined in section TODO, and $\eta = n_1 / n_2$ is the ratio of the refraction indices. The Fresnel reflectance integral $F_{dr}$ is usually approximated with an analytical expression:

$$
F_{dr} = -\frac{1.440}{\eta^2} + \frac{0.710}{\eta} + 0.668 + 0.0036 \eta
$$

Given the boundary condition, we can then model the subsurface scattering in a point $\x_o$ with two small sources on the point, a configuration called a \emph{dipole}. One source is placed beneath the surface, called the \emph{real source}, while the other one is placed above the surface, called \emph{virtual source}. The first source actually models the subsurface scattering effect, while the second one reduces the first in order to account for the boundary conditions. Refer to figure TODO for a visual detail on the setup.

The real source is placed one mean free path beneath the surface, at $z_r = 1 / \sigma_t'$, while the virtual one is placed symmetrically according to the end of the boundary conditions, ad a distance $z_v = z_r + 4 A D$. From $z_r$ and $z_v$ we can calculate the distances $d_r$ and $d_v$ from the entrance point $\x_i$. Given $r = \|\x_o -\x_i\|$, we obtain:


\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
d_r &= \sqrt{z_r^2 + r^2} \\
d_v &= \sqrt{z_v^2 + r^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Given these constraint and using equation TODO for the two point sources, we obtain an equation for the BSSRDF in a semi infinite medium:

$$
S_d(\x_i,\vomega_i,\x_i,\vomega_o) = \frac{\alpha'}{4 \pi^2} \left[\frac{z_r (1 + \sigma_{tr} d_r) \; e^{-\sigma_{tr} d_r}}{d_r^3} + \frac{z_v (1 + \sigma_{tr} d_v) \; e^{-\sigma_{tr} d_v}}{d_v^3} \right]
$$

Where $\alpha' = \sigma_s' / \sigma_t'$ is called \emph{reduced albedo}.

The model so far described was intended to model only the multiple scattering BSSRDF term, $S_d$. In order to obtain the full BSSRDF $S$, a single scattering term $S^{(1)}$ must be added. There are in literature many approaches ot model single scattering, that are too long to explain here. The final BSSRDF equation for the Jensen TODO model then becomes:

$$
S(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) = S_d(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) + S^{(1)}(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o)
$$

\subsection{Directional dipole model}

Various evolution to the standard dipole model have been proposed throughout the years. In this chapter, we will introduce the BSSRDF approximation called \emph{directional dipole}, proposed by Frisvad et al. In the standard dipole model, in fact, the diffusive part of the BSSRDF depends only on the distance between the point of incidence and the point of emergence, that is $S_d(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) = S_d(\|\x_o - \x_i\|)$. 

The directional dipole model, based on the diffusion approximation, accounts for the direction of the incoming light in its calculations, in order to model the scattering effects more precisely. Moreover, the model, instead of splitting the BSSRDF in a multiple and single scattering term, splits the BSSRDF into a diffusive term $S_d$ and a term $S_{\delta E}$, called \emph{reduced intensity}, that can be computed using the delta-Eddington approximation. The final BSSRDF thus becomes:

$$
S(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o) = T(\eta,\vomega_i) (S_d(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o) + S_{\delta E}(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o, \vomega_o)) T(\eta,\vomega_o)
$$

Where $T$ are the Fresnel transmission coefficients for the incoming and outgoing directions. We note also that the diffusive part of the BSSRDF does not depend on the outgoing direction $\vomega_o$. 

\textbf{Diffusive BSSRDF}

The diffusive part of the directional dipole model uses a first-order approximation of the RTE, that for a point light in an infinite medium gives the following fluence:

$$
\phi(\x_o, \theta) = \frac{\Phi}{4\pi D} \frac{e^{\sigma_{tr} r}}{r} \left( 1 + 3D\frac{1 + \sigma_{tr} r}{r}\cos\theta\right)
$$

Where $D$ and $\sigma_{tr}$ are the two scattering coefficients defined beforehand, $r = \|\x_o\|$ and 

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\x \cdot \vomega_{12}}{r}
$$

Where $\vomega_{12}$ is the refracted vector as defined in TODO. Comparing with equation TODO, we can see that we introduced a new term that depends on the angle between the refracted incoming light vector and the vector connecting incidence and emergence. 

Using the diffusion approximation, we can first establish a relationship between the radiant exitance $M(\x_o)$ amd the diffusive BSSRDF $S'_d$ in an infinite medium:

$$
\frac{d M(\x_o)}{d \Phi_i(\x, \vomega_i)} = T(\eta, \vomega_i) S'_d(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o) \; 4\pi\csinv 
$$

where $\csinv$ is related to the integral on the hemisphere of the fresnel coefficients. Using the definition of radiant exitance and inserting inside the classical iffusion approximation, we reach the diffusion formulation of the radiant exitance:

$$
M(\x_o) = \cs \phi(\x_o) + \ce D \vec{n}_o \cdot \nabla \phi(\x_o)
$$

Again, $\cs$ and $\ce$ are two terms that are related to the integration of the fresnel coefficients. Combining the three equations TODO, we reach the final form for our diffusive BSSRDF in an infinite medium:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&S'_d(\x, \vomega_{12}, r) = \frac{1}{4\csinv} \frac{1}{4\pi^2} \frac{e^{-\sigma_{tr} r}}{r^3} \\
&\bigg[ \cs \left(\frac{r^2}{D} + 3 (1 + \sigma_{tr} r ) \x \cdot \vomega_{12} \right) - \\
&-\ce \bigg(3D (1 + \sigma_{tr} r) \; \vomega_{12} \cdot \vec{n}_o - \\ 
&-\left( (1 + \sigma_{tr} r) + 3D \frac{3(1 + \sigma_{tr} r ) + (\sigma_{tr} r)^2}{r^2}  \x \cdot \vomega_{12} \right)  \x \cdot \vec{n}_o \bigg) \bigg] 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{mybox}
\begin{center}\textbf{Fresnel integrals}\end{center}
The two terms $\cs$ and $\ce$ originally come from integrating the outgoing Fresnel transmittance over the whole outgoing hemisphere, weighted with a cosine term. The two functions are defined as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\cs &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{2\pi} T(\eta,\vomega) (\vec{n}_o \cdot \vomega) d \vomega \\
\ce &= \frac{3}{4\pi} \int_{2\pi} T(\eta,\vomega) (\vec{n}_o \cdot \vomega)^2 d \vomega \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

These two integrals can be rearranged in order to express them in terms of reflectance instead of transmittance, recalling $R = 1 - T$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\cs &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \left( \pi - \int_{2\pi} R(\eta,\vomega) (\vec{n}_o \cdot \vomega) d \vomega \right) = \frac{1}{4}(1 - 2 C_1)\\
\ce &= \frac{3}{4\pi} \left(\frac{2\pi}{3} - \int_{2\pi} R(\eta,\vomega) (\vec{n}_o \cdot \vomega) d \vomega \right) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - 3 C_2) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Even with this rearrangement the integral cannot be expressed in closed form. TODO and TODO use a convenient polynomial approximation for the two coeffiients $C_1$ and $C_2$, expressed as:

$$
2 C_1\approx 
\begin{cases}			
	+0.919317-3.4793\eta + 6.75335\eta^2 -7.80989\eta^3\\ \hspace{3.2cm}+4.98554\eta^4-1.36881\eta^5& \eta < 1 \\
	-9.23372 + 22.2272\eta-20.9292\eta^2 + 10.2291\eta^3\\ \hspace{3.2cm}-2.54396\eta^4 + 0.254913\eta^5 & \eta \geq 1

\end{cases}
$$
$$
3 C_2 \approx
\begin{cases}
0.828421-2.62051\eta + 3.36231\eta^2 -1.95284\eta^3\\ \hspace{3cm}+ 0.236494\eta^4 + 0.145787\eta^5 & \eta < 1 \\
-1641.1 + \frac{135.926}{\eta^3} - \frac{656.175}{\eta^2} + \frac{1376.53}{\eta} + 1213.67\eta \\ \hspace{3cm} -568.556\eta^2 + 164.798\eta^3\\ \hspace{3cm} -27.0181\eta^4 + 1.91826\eta^5 & \eta \geq 1.
\end{cases}
$$
\end{mybox}

\textbf{Boundary conditions}

As the name implies, also for the directional dipole we model the boundary conditions on the material interface using a dipole. In this case, however, instead of using two point light sources, we use two ray sources, a real and a virtual one. As in the standard dipole, the source is displaced towards the normal of a distance $d_e$. In the case of the standard dipole, we use $2D$, that becomes $2 A D$ in the case of mismatching indices of refraction on the interface. In the case of the directional dipole, we use 

$$
d_e = \frac{2.131 D}{\sqrt{\alpha'}}
$$ 

Where we recall $\alpha' = \sigma_s' / \sigma_t'$ as the reduced albedo. This result have been proven TODO to be consistent with numerical simulations of the RTE. In addition, the A term is modified using the hemispheric Fresnel integrals:

$$
A(\eta) = \frac{1 - \ce}{2 \cs}
$$

As the standard dipole, the directional dipole assumes a semi-infinite medium given the previous boundary conditions. In order to relax this assumptions, we need to further extend the model in order to reduce undesired effects. One first modification proposed by TODO is to use a modified tangent plane defined by the normal $\vec{n}_i^*$ to mirror the real source towards the mirror light source, instead of the obvious one defined by $\vec{n}_i$. We define the modified normal as follows:

$$
\vec{n}_i^* = 
\begin{dcases} 
\vec{n}_i & \text{for} \x_o = \x_i \\
\frac{\x_o - \x_i}{\|\x_o - \x_i\|} \times \frac{\vec{n}_i \times (\x_o - \x_i)}{\|\vec{n}_i \times (\x_o - \x_i)\|} & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}
$$

Another important modification is the distance to the real source. In the standard dipole, we used $d_r = \sqrt{z_r^2 + r^2}$, with $z_r = 1 / \sigma_t'$, which is the average distance a photon travels within the material before being absorbed or scattered. The problem of this definition is that it introduces a singularity in $r = 0$. Moreover, the standard dipole becomes fairly imprecise when $r$ is small, overestimating the overall effect. In order to avoid these problems, TODO proposed a more complicated definition of $d_r$ that matches simulation of transport theory more closely. For the details, see Appendix B in the original paper. $d_r$ is defined as follows, recalling $\sigma_t = \sigma_s + \sigma_a$:

$$
d_r^2 = \begin{dcases}
r^2 + D \mu_0 (D \mu_0 - 2 d_e \cos \beta) & \mu_0 \geq 0 \  \text{(frontlit)}\\
r^2 + \frac{1}{(3 \sigma_t)^2} & \mu_0 < 0 \ \text{(backlit)}
\end{dcases}
$$
Where $\mu_0 = - \vomega_{12} \cdot \vec{n}_o$ is an indicator if the point $\x_o$ is frontlit or backlit. $\beta$ is a geometry term that is evaluated as:

$$
\cos \beta = - \sqrt{\frac{r^2 - (\x \cdot \vomega_{12})^2}{r^2 + d_e^2}}
$$

Combining all the corrections seen so far, we can write the final form of our BSSRDF model, that is a combination of the real source term minus the virtual source term:

$$
S_d(\x_i, \vomega_i, \x_o) = S'_d(\x_o - \x_i, \vomega_{12}, d_r) - S'_d(\x_o - \x_v, \vomega_{v}, d_v)
$$

Where the extra coefficients are defined as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
x_v &= x_i + 2 A d_e \vec{n}_i^* \\
\vomega_v &= \vomega_{12} - 2 (\vomega_{12} \cdot \vec{n}_i^*) \vec{n}_i^* \\
d_v &= \|x_o - x_v\|
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The directional dipole model described in this chapter, gives a better result that the standard dipole, at the extra price of add calculations. In particular, the model improves the previous ones for highly forward scattering materials, where it is sensibly close to the path traced result. The goals of this thesis is to provide a real-time implementation of it. Given this theoretical introduction, in the next section we will describe our contribution in order to breakdown the problems and the issues of a real-time implementation.
